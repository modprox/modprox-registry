        <h4>Welcome to the modprox project!</h4>

        <p>
         The modprox project was created out of a need for a Go Module Proxy
        which has first-class support for enterprise Gitlab that has strong
        requirements for authenticated access. Existing proxies have/had no
        support for this use case, and so this project was started with an
        emphasis configurability and adaptability to the more "specialized"
        proxy use-cases.
        </p>
        <p>We think this proxy could be useful for other organizations,
        and so the development work has been open-source from the very beginning.
        Together, we hope to build a great open source Go Module
        Proxy focused on the internal hosting use case.
        Documentation for installing, configuring, and managing the
        modprox components can be found on
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://modprox.org">modprox.org</a>.

        <h4>Open Source on Github!</h4>
        <p>
        The source code for all of the modprox components is available
        on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/modprox">Github</a>.
        Contributions are welcome! Particularly if you'd like to add some
        significant feature in support of additional "enterprise-y" use cases,
        we'd like to work towards getting those features merged!
        </p>
